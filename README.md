# RT2_assignment1_Interactive_JupyterNotebook

This project implements an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) in Jupyter Notebook for motion planning of a mobile robot. It's based on ResearchTrack 1 Assignment #2, providing controls to set/cancel targets, visualize trajectory and track goal achievements.

## Getting Started

1. Install ROS Dependencies: `sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-rosbridge-suite` and `sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-tf2-web-republisher`.
2. Launch ROS Nodes: `roslaunch assignment_2_2023 assignment1.launch`.
3. Run Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`.
4. Open `Amani_Ghomrrani_RT2_Assignment2.ipynb`.
5. Interact: Use buttons to set/cancel targets, visualize trajectory.
6. For this particular project check the README file inside the RT_Assignment2_Amani_Ghomtani folder.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for robot motion planning.
- Interactive Buttons for target control.
- Real-time trajectory and target visualization.
- Goal achievement display.
- ROS integration for Odometry to set/cancel the goal.
- IPython widgets for dynamic interactions.

## Prerequisites

- ROS.
- Jupyter Notebook.
